## Projects
**Capital Bike Share Operations**
- This study was conducted against a backdrop of growing awareness and regulatory requirements for accessibility in public transport. Between 2015 and 2022, the SNCF welcomed an increase in disabled passengers, prompting an urgent need for a thorough analysis and improvement of services offered.
- **Tools & Methodologies**: Data analysis was conducted using R for statistical computations and Tableau for visualizations. The methodologies included correlation analysis, linear regression, and cluster analysis to identify patterns and draw insights.

**Baseball Performance Prediction using Statistical Modeling**
- This project demonstrates my ability to utilize statistical modeling in R to analyze baseball data and predict player performance metrics. I leveraged the Lahman package to build models that provide insights into:
- **Team Salary Trends:** A linear regression model predicts team mean salaries based on the year, revealing salary inflation trends.
- **Number of Runs Scored:** A Poisson regression model predicts the number of runs a player scores, considering factors like hits, year, position, height, and age.
- **Division Winners:** A logistic regression model with Lasso penalization predicts division winners based on various team-level data (excluding identifiers).
- **Tools & Methodologies**: - Data acquisition and manipulation using R.
- Exploratory data analysis and visualization techniques.
- Implementation of statistical modeling methods (linear regression, Poisson regression, logistic regression with Lasso).
- Model interpretation and evaluation.

**Student Monitoring System**
- Educators often lack real-time insights into student engagement and performance in online learning environments. Traditional methods for monitoring student progress, like manual review of test scores, are time-consuming and offer limited visibility.
This project proposes a student monitoring system designed to address these challenges. It offers various functionalities to analyze student performance and identify areas for improvement.
- **Tools & Methodologies**: The project leveraged SQLite to create a database of student test results and further utilized Python packages to do analysis.


**Customer Segmentation and Risk Prediction using WEKA**
- Businesses often struggle to understand their customer base and predict future behavior. Traditional methods like demographic segmentation may not capture the full picture.
Hence, I have presented a modern analytical approach to understand and predict customer behavior.
- **Tools & Methodologies**: This project utilizes WEKA to perform data pre-processing, feature selection, classification, and clustering on a customer dataset.

**Automated Image Classification for Improved Product Management**
- Businesses in various sectors, like e-commerce, manufacturing, and logistics, struggle with manual image classification for product management and inventory control. This process is time-consuming, error-prone, and expensive, especially when dealing with large image datasets.
This project proposes a system that classifies new, unseen images into predefined categories representing different products.
- **Tools & Methodologies**: This project proposes a machine learning approach to automate image classification for improved product management and inventory control. The system utilizes supervised learning techniques to train a model on labeled image data.

**Covid-19 Data Analysis with Tableau**
- The COVID-19 pandemic has posed unprecedented challenges for governments and businesses. Predicting the trajectory of the virus and its impact is crucial for implementing effective public health measures and business continuity plans.
- **Tools & Methodologies**: The Dataset has been taken from WHO Covid-19 Data. This project uses Excel for the Data Cleansing and preparation. The visualisation and Analysis have been done on Tableau. 

**Global Maternal Mortality Rates and Birth Outcomes Analysis with Tableau**
- This project utilizes Tableau, a powerful data visualization tool, to create an interactive dashboard that presents maternal mortality rates and birth outcomes data in an engaging and informative way.
- **Tools & Methodologies**: The Dataset has been taken from WHO maternal mortality rates  Data. This project uses Excel for the Data Cleansing and preparation. The visualisation and Analysis have been done on Tableau.
**Data-Driven Sales Growth - A Financial and Sales Analysis for Increased Revenue**
- This project demonstrates the power of data analysis in driving significant sales improvement. I partnered with a client (name or industry if confidential) to conduct a comprehensive financial and sales analysis using Excel and Tableau.
- **Tools & Methodologies**: Excel, Powepoint and Tableau.

**Streamlining Real Estate Development with a Comprehensive Portal - Functional and Technical Documentation**
- This project addresses the challenge of streamlining communication and collaboration within real estate development projects. It focuses on creating a functional and technical document for a Real Estate and Development portal.
- **Tools & Methodologies**: Microsoft Visio.
