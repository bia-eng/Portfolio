The Coursework consists of five programs named as:
1) CWPreprocessing.py
2) testResults.py
3) studentPerformance.py
4) underperformingStudent.py
5) hardworkingStudents.py

All the above programs are a function and they can be accessed via menu.ipynb.
Please note that CWPreprocessing.py cannot be accessed via menu.ipynb since I, was unable to convert that into the function.
The zip folder contains two folders, i.e :  TestResult folder that consists of the raw files  and Resultdatabase.db that consists of a SQL database.

CWPreprocessing.py: This program contains a python script that creates SQL database by loading, cleaning, and transforming the CSV files. 

testResults.py:  This function provides the student’s performance in each test by visualising the test results of the students by fetching the research_id.

studentPerformance.py:  This function displays the student’s performance in each question by fetching the id and plotting the test results with the help of matplotlib.pyplot. Furthermore, this function visualizes the absolute and relative performance of a student in each question.

underperformingStudent.py: This is the function is defined for the students who did not perform well in the tests. It classifies the student as an underperforming if the student did not receive required marks in the subject. 

hardworkingStudents.py: This is the function for students who did not have prior coding skills. It classifies all those students as hardworking students. 

menu.ipynb: This programme provides an instinctive menu to the module leader, enabling access to the given functions. This menu is built on a Python Graphical User Interface (GUI) and is sorted in Jupyter Notebook. 

DAFunction.py: I was not able to do this part as I did not have the clarity on which generalised functions should be included in this.
